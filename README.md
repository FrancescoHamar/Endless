# Endless (2017-2018)

## Project Lore:
This project was done with the sole purpose of learning, no revenue was generated from this code despite having some ad implementation.

One of my first experiences with coding something more than a turtle going in circles. Furthermore, definitely my first experience with c#, unity, and making a complete game. The idea was to slightly change a marble zigzagger game by understanding how the source code for that game worked.

Thus it became a 3D Infinte Platformer, where you (a cube (red)) Try to stay on a never ending zig-zaggin path forward.

## Some notes:
Unity Store libraries and plugins:
  - Unity Ads
  - Simple UI (V.1.0.)

At some point during the project the cube was a blender render, however this turned out to be out of the scope of the expecations.

## The game's look:
This wasn't the main objective when making this project, I therefore limited myself to a rather simple look. 
The gameobject has no styling, while the tiles are simple blocks.

An interesting mechanic is the following: the blue tiles fall, once the player touches them , and are then recycled when making the new path, this way the number of tiles in the game stays at a constant without need of rendering infinite many of them.

The coins were made using blender, while the menus are all animated and constructed with unity engine tools.
